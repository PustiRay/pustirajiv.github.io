        <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                <b>Image:</b> 
                    <br>
                    
                        The HTML image tag is represented by the "img" element. It is used to embed images in a web page.
                         For example of how you can use the image tag with a brief description:<br> The src attribute specifies the source (file path or URL) of the image.
                         The alt attribute provides alternative text for accessibility and is displayed if the image cannot be loaded.<br>
                         The width and height attributes define the dimensions of the image in pixels, ensuring proper layout even before the image is fully loaded.<br>
                
            </li>
          
            <li>
                <b>List:</b>
                   <br>
                    The HTML list tag is represented by three main elements: "ul" for an unordered list, "ol" for an ordered list, and "li" for list items.
                    <ul>
                       <li>Unordered List "ul" - This tag is used to create a bulleted list, where each item is marked with a bullet point. </li> 
                        <li>Ordered List "ol"- This tag is employed to create a numbered list, where each item is sequentially numbered. </li>
                        <li>List Item "li" - This tag is used within "ul" or "ol" to define individual items in the list. Each "li" element represents a specific entry in the list.</li>
                    </ul>
               
            </li>
          
            <li>
                <b>Paragraph:</b>
                  <br>
                    The HTML paragraph tag, represented by "p", is used to define paragraphs in a web page. There are Opening and Closing Tags in paragraph.<br>
                    The paragraph tag is comprised of an opening tag "p" and a closing tag "/p", encapsulating the text content within.
              
            </li>
          
            <li>
                <b>Heading:</b>
                 <br>
                    The HTML heading tags, represented by "h1" to "h6", are used to define headings and subheadings on a web page. The "h1" tag is used for <br>
                    the main heading of the page, while "h2" to "h6" represent subheadings with decreasing levels of importance.
                
            </li>
          
            <li>
                <b>Table:</b>
                   <br>
                    The HTML "table" tag is used to create tables on a web page, allowing developers to organize and present data in a tabular format. <br>
                    Within the "table" tag, the structure is defined using additional tags such as "tr" for table rows, "th" for table headers, and "td" for table data cells.<br>
                    Attributes like border, cellspacing, and cellpadding can be applied to the "table" tag to control the appearance and spacing of the table elements, providing <br> 
                    flexibility in designing the layout of the table.
